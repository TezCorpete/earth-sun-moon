      <h2> What Causes The Seasons?</h2>
      <p> It takes the earth about 365 days to orbit the sun in a counter-clockwise direction and with this we get seasons. When the Earth orbits around the Sun is does not move it only rotates so both the north and south hemispheres will always face the same direction in space. This means that when one hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight the other isnt (this is becuase the earth is titled). In the image you see that on the right the south hemisphere is getting more derect sunlight and on the left its the opposite. If one hemisphere is getting more direct sunlight that means its summer and winter for the other hemisphere. The only time thats not true is during fall or spring when both hemispheres get the sun amount of sunlight. If you lived in the northern hemipshere spring would be shown by the earth at the top of the image and fall at the bottom</p>
